AI¬≤MD (Artificial Intelligence for Accelerated Molecular Dynamics) is a hybrid framework that integrates ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) to enable fast and chemically accurate simulations of complex reactive systems, such as plasma-surface interactions and high-temperature decomposition.

üöÄ 1. Accelerated Dynamics via MLIP
	‚Ä¢	Replace traditional DFT-based forces with MLIP models like ORBNet, which drastically reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	Run high-temperature simulations (e.g., 2000 K) with millions of steps using neural network-based potentials trained on high-level quantum data.

üîç 2. Real-Time Chemical Analysis
	‚Ä¢	Automatically extract molecular species from XYZ trajectories using bonding heuristics based on UFF radii.
	‚Ä¢	Use depth-first search (DFS) to cluster atoms into molecular fragments and track their evolution across time.
